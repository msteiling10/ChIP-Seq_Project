Hello thank you for using our repo!
This snakemake pipeline is intended to analyze ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data for the species Plasmodium falciparum.


SampleDownloadPFal.py:
This Script is made to download the initial data to run through the pipeline. 
It will create a directory to store samples called 
"initial_data"
The function will use the operating system to check for the directory. 
Subproccess allows for the running of commandline tool from within Python. 
To adapt the Sample Download code to other samples, the list at line 19 can be changed to other SRR/SRA numbers
Please check that SampleDownloadPFal.py is in your current working directory before using ./
Otherwise list full path


Example to run:
```bash
python ./SampleDownloadPFal.py
```
To run the Snakefile in background with a log file outputted
```bash
nohup snakemake -s snakefile -c 4 --configfile CompProjectconfig.yaml > snakemake.log 2>&1 &
```

To run the Snakefile cleanup
```bash
snakemake cleanup -c 1 --configfile CompProjectconfig.yaml
```

To See What Rules your Snakefile Can See:
```bash
snakemake --list
```
