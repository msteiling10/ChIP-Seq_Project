# Welcome to the "PlasmodiumPeakProcess" Github

This Snakemake pipeline is intended to analyze ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data for the species *Plasmodium falciparum*.






## Clone the repository
We recommend cloning this to your machine. Follow the instructions below. 

Before cloning, configure your Git identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name 'example'
git config --global user.email 'example@example.com'
```

Then clone the repository using this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hcallachor/ChIP-Seq_Project
```

## Directions to Install Softwares

### Install Miniconda (Conda)

install conda using this command:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh
```

set conda path:

```bash
bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
conda init bash
```

---

### Install OpenJDK from conda-forge
This is a version of java you can obtain through conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk

# Verify installation
java -version
```

---

### Trimmomatic

Requires Java.

```bash
java -jar trimmomatic-0.39.jar
```

Please see the link below for further details and to download trimmomatic-0.39.jar:
https://github.com/usadellab/Trimmomatic

---

### Picard MarkDuplicates

Requires Java.

```bash
java -jar picard.jar
```

Please see the link below for further details and to download:
https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/tag/3.4.0

---

### Create environment and install macs3

```bash
conda create -n macs3_env python=3.9
conda activate macs3_env
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge macs3
```

---

### Create environment and install bedGraphToBigWig
```bash
conda install bioconda::ucsc-bedgraphtobigwig
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge ucsc-bedgraphtobigwig openssl=1.0
```
After macs3 is run files need to be converted into bedGraph format and then bigwig format in order to be run through the UCSC genome browser. These files need to be hosted on a web server in order to be compatible with the UCSC Genome Browser. A convenient option is to upload the bigwig file to GitHub, then copy the raw file URL and paste it into the custom tracks function found under the "My Data" tab of the genome browser website.

---

### Create a Python Environment for running this pipeline

```bash
conda create -n my_environment python=3.9 -y
conda activate my_environment
```

---

### Install PyYAML

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyyaml
```

---

## To Begin Using the Pipeline

### 1. Configure your samples
   
Edit the file:

```
YourSamplesHere.yaml
```

This yaml connects to the sample download code to begin downloading the data you would like to use. 

You should not need to make any edits to the SampleDownload.py code itself, except for adding the reference genome if you plan to work with something other than *Plasmodium falciparum*.

Add the **SRA IDs** you want to analyze.  
An example format is already included in the file.

---

### Sample test dataset

For quick testing of the pipeline, use:

**SRR34020775**

This dataset is very small and should run in ~2 minutes.

---


### 2. Download sample data
Run the download script:

```bash
python ./SampleDownload.py
```

### What it does:
- Creates a directory called **initial_data/**
- Reads SRA IDs from `YourSamplesHere.yaml`
- Downloads sequencing data using SRA tools
- Generates the config file for Snakemake

**Implementation notes:**
- Uses Python `subprocess` to run command-line tools
- Checks and creates directories using the operating system
- SRA list can be modified inside the script (line 19)
- Reference genome settings are defined in the output dictionary

---

## Running the pipeline

### Run Snakemake

```bash
snakemake -s Snakefile -c 4 --configfile CompProjectconfig.yaml
```

### Run Snakemake (background mode)

```bash
nohup snakemake -s Snakefile -c 4 --configfile CompProjectconfig.yaml 
```

---

### Run cleanup workflow
```bash
snakemake cleanup -c 1 --configfile CompProjectconfig.yaml
```

---

### List available rules

```bash
snakemake --list
```

---

## Notes

- Java is required for Trimmomatic and Picard
- Always activate the conda environment before running Snakemake
- Ensure `YourSamplesHere.yaml` is properly formatted
- Modify reference genome settings in `SampleDownload.py` if needed
