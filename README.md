Hello thank you for using our repo!
This snakemake pipeline is intended to analyze ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data for the species Plasmodium falciparum.

To Begin:
You need to add your samples to the "YourSamplesHere.yaml"
First: open the YourSamplesHere.yaml
Next: add the SRAs you plan to use, there is a formatting example inside the YourSamplesHere.yaml
This yaml connects to the sample download code to begin downloading the data you would like to use. 
You should not need to make any edits to the SampleDownloadV2.py code itself, except for adding the reference genome if
you plan to work with something other than Plasmodium falciparum

SampleDownload.py:
This Script is made to download the initial data to run through the pipeline and create the config file needed for the pipeline.
It will create a directory to store samples called 
"initial_data"
The function will use the operating system to check for the directory. 
Subproccess allows for the running of commandline tool from within Python. 
To adapt the Sample Download code to other samples, the list at line 19 can be changed to other SRR/SRA numbers
Please check that SampleDownloadV2.py is in your current working directory before using ./
Otherwise list full path
Additionally, if you need to change the reference genome you wish to use, this is under the output dictionary 


Example to run:
```bash
python ./SampleDownloadV2.py
```
To run the Snakefile in background with a log file outputted
Must run with the conda Macs3 environment activated
```bash
conda activate macs3_env
```
```bash
nohup snakemake -s snakefile -c 4 --configfile CompProjectconfig.yaml > snakemake.log 2>&1 &
```

To run the Snakefile cleanup
```bash
snakemake cleanup -c 1 --configfile CompProjectconfig.yaml
```

To See What Rules your Snakefile Can See:
```bash
snakemake --list
```
